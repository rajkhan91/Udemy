### What is this?
- A FREE Ionic (5) template from my Project **[#100ions](https://www.takethatdesign.com/100ions/)**. I aim to release 100 Free Templates written using Ionic Framework (5). See all of them at [https://www.takethatdesign.com/100ions/](https://www.takethatdesign.com/100ions/)


### What do I get?

- More detailed and pixel-perfect in terms of colors, typography, spacing, sizing, animation effects,...
- Better organized in components and services, highly reusable
- Dark theme
- Support and consultation services


### Why are you doing this? (giving your time and effort for free?)
- I've been working with Ionic as my weekend projects for 4+ years (since Ionic 1). I can't tell you enough how much I love creating themes with Ionic
- I want to set examples and share my best practices of Ionic development to people who are new to this exciting technology
